Prerequisites:
=============
R packages required:

- cranvas (which, in turn, depends (not only) on qtbase and qtpaint)

Please, read https://github.com/ggobi/cranvas/wiki to learn how to
install these packages. 



Tools
=====

Hadley Wickham's `devtools' package (e.g. https://github.com/hadley/devtools) 
could come handy.



idendro
=======

i) directly from github, using the `devtools' R package:

  > library(devtools)
  > install_github('idendro','tsieger')

ii) manually:

- get `idendro' sources from github https://github.com/tsieger/idendro

    $ git clone git://github.com/tsieger/idendro.git

- build and install:

  > library(devtools)
  > build(<path to idendro sources>) # results in an archive file
        # containing the built R package
  > install.packages(<path to the idendro archive>)
